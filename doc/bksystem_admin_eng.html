            <p>
               All data stored in a database (Type: SQLite) in <b>tables</b> stored. The contents of the tables to display and edit. This case, individual fields or entire rows processed, inserted, or deleted. Using SQL queries, tables are combined. Predefined queries are called <b>Views</b> . These do not contain its own data, but are calculated directly from the tables fibrillation. The concepts in summary:
            </p>
            <ul>
               <li><b>Table</b> contains the records</li>
               <li><b>View:</b> shows records is calculated from tables (and possibly other views)</li>
               <li><b>SQL query:</b> describes how tables are combined and will meet Bedingnungen resulting data.</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h3 id="software">Software</h3>
            <h4 id="managing_database">Database Manager</h4>
               <p>
                  The best way with the following tasks with <a title="Homepage" href="https://www.google.de/search?q=sqlitemanager+firefox&btnI=imfeelinglucky">SQLite Manager (Firefox extension)</a> do. This can easily edit and export the tables and insert images (products, see below), make queries and view or views.
               </p>
               <p>
                  After installation, place the SQLiteManager in Firefox menu <i>Tools</i> . After starting <i>Database -&gt; Connect to database</i> and locate the appropriate file (bksystem.sqlite) and open. We are interested in the tables user_accounts, products, bill_dates, sales, and current_bill current_consumption. Select appropriate table and tab / tab <i>Browse</i> to select. Now you can see the data sets, which create, edit and delete.
               </p>
               <p>
                  <b>Warning:</b> Confirmed, changes can not directly make undo (CTRL-Z Undo, Undo), but only add, delete, etc..
               </p>      
                  The steps are described for the SQLite Manager, but can also be accomplished with any other program to manipulate sqlite databases. Contents of tables in the tab <i>browsing</i> be viewed and bear pray. SQLiteManager offers (Tab also a box <i>running SQL</i> ) that in the code can be inserted and run. For some tasks finished code is provided, possibly in the eingf√ºgt parameters (eg replace "John Doe" by value) must be, and must then be carried out.
               <p>
               </p>
            <h4 id="tab_calc">Spreadsheet</h4>
               <p>
                  The layout of invoices, print, produce, of. PDF is a program needs to spreadsheet. Examples are Microsoft Excel, OpenOffice Calc and LibreOffice Calc. All steps are described for LibreOffice Calc. The procedure with other programs should be very similar.
               </p>
      </div>
      <div id="content_div">
         <ol>
            <h2 id="user_accounts"><li>User Accounts</li></h2>
               <p>
                  The user accounts are in the table <b>user_accounts</b> saved.
               </p>
            <ul>
               <h3 id="add_user"><li>Add Users</li></h3>
                  <p>
                     To create a new user table <i>browsing</i> and <i>Add Record</i> . It must only be given first name and last name, all other fields are automatically assigned to valid values.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     It may of course also accounts such as choral conductor, barbecue, cash purchase, event, etc. created 24/12/2013.

               <h3 id="delete_user"><li>Deleting a user</li></h3>
                  <p>   
                     Users may also be deleted. Is it not settled sales by the user is terminated with an error message. Otherwise all of its sales are then deleted from the database (Table sales).
                  </p>
               <h3 id="lock_user"><li>User Lock / Unlock</li></h3>       
                  <p>
                     User accounts may be blocked. Simply select the appropriate record and edit the status field. The importance of the status field is: 1 = user account is locked, 0 if not locked. Default value is 0.
                  </p>
               <h3 id="user_querry"><li>Balance inquiry</li></h3>
                  <p>

                  </p>
                  <p>
                     Personalized (complete or accumulated) shopping lists can be created only through SQL queries. SQLiteManager offers (Tab also a box <i>running SQL</i> ) that in the code can be inserted and run. Many queries are possible, the following are ready-for copy + paste. The name placeholder must be replaced with the name you want:
                  </p>

                  <p>
                     An export the results tables this query is possible ( <i>Action -&gt; Save result to CSV file</i> ), then open with a spreadsheet), or view as CSV and can be copied directly. 
                  </p>
            </ul>
         
            <h2 id="products"><li>Product List</li></h2>
               <p>
                  The products are in the table <b>products</b> stored.
               </p>
            <ul>
               <h3 id="add_product"><li>Add Products</li></h3>
                  <p>
                     To add a product to EAN, name, price (NOTE: Spot, ie 1.2) are given. Optionally, an image can be added
                  </p>   
                  <p> 
                     EAN is the Eurpoean Article Number, which is found on every product under the random code. It is recommended to use this number. Any other <b>unique</b> number is also OK, so define your own products, such as beer, 0.5 liters, etc..
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     The price is set in euros (or whatever currency). It should be noted that a point is used (eg 1.25). The price may be changed at any time. Products already sold are not covered by the price change. In the settlement, the product will appear twice.
                  </p>
                  <p> 
                     The image of the product is optional. Popular products are specifically indicated in a list with images. Accepted formats: jpg, jpeg, jpg, svg?. The best are jp(e)gs. The files should not exceed 500 KB in size, 100 KB goes well. Google images helps here quick, with names or EANs. In SQLiteManager in the edit/create form is a browse button, that allows easy import of images into the database. 
                  </p>
               <h3 id="delete_product"><li>Delete products</li></h3>
                  <p>
                     Products can be deleted from the table products. Products are currently not settled, deleting will be canceled. All of the related sales are usually deleted from the database (Table sales). Alternatively, set the product to not display (status = 1).
                  </p>
               <h3 id="hide_product"><li>Products in the UI to hide the program</li></h3>
                  <p>
                     To avoid having to delete every product sold out it may be hidden. The state indicates whether a product is to be displayed in the program (0) or not (1). The status column in the product process.
                  </p>
            </ul>

            <h2 id="sales"><li>Sales</li></h2>
               <p>
                  The table <b>sales</b> will be written by the program, and EAN, User ID, ‚Äã‚Äãand timestamp of the sale price.
               </p>
            <ul>      
               <h3><a name="sale_cancel"><li>Sales Cancel</li></a></h3>
                  <p>
                     Sales are undone (if not yet settled) by setting the corresponding cell <b>price</b> to 0.
                  </p>
               <h3><a name="sale_cleanup"><li>Sales delete</li></a></h3>
                  <p>
                     If the sales data is no longer needed (eg after a cash balance), the corresponding records can be deleted. Manually or <a href="SQL_Code/sales_cleanup.txt" title="View Code">automatically</a> (erases all data billed). Please only delete records when billed and invoiced billings can not be undone!
                  </p>

            <h2 id="bill"><li>Statements</li></h2>
               <p>The table <b>bill_dates</b> contains the billing reference dates.</p>
               <p>
                  Give it six views that the consumption of <b>consumption</b> , account balances <b>account_balance</b> and bank statements <b>account_list</b> Show. Here, the prefix refers <b>previous</b> post on already billed (invoice date), <b>current</b> at the current consumption (unbilled items). If a settlement at this time to create, these <b>current</b> views thus contain no data. All that was found there, is now in the <b>previous</b> display.  
               </p>
               <p>   
                  The View <b>previous_account_list</b> contains the entire current account, including userid, full names, product information, and total number of each product. From this list, which can create detailed accounts <a href="bksystem_admin_eng.html#pivot_table">create pivot table</a>

                  <p>
                     For billing needs only a date in the table <b>bill_dates</b> be inserted. When creating a new entry is set automatically bill_id. It's just the time stamp indicated is to be made ‚Äã‚Äãat which time a statement. The time stamp must be in the format <b>YYYY-MM-DD HH: MM: SS</b> command (eg 2012-01-16 20:35:59). The specified date must be newer than the last entry, and not be in the future. Bills passed at a time, however, are quite possible.
