            <p>
               All data is stored in a database (Type: SQLite) in <b>tables</b>. The contents of the tables can be displayed and edited.
               Individual fields or entire rows can be changed, inserted, or deleted. Using SQL queries, tables are combined and filtered.
               Predefined queries are called <b>Views</b>. These look like tables, but do not contain its own data, but are calculated
               directly from the tables. The concepts in summary:
            </p>
            <ul>
               <li><b>Table</b> contain the records (data)</li>
               <li><b>View:</b> shows records and is calculated from tables (and possibly other views)</li>
               <li><b>SQL query:</b> describes how tables are combined, filtered and defines criteria for displaying data.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3 id="software">Software</h3>
            <h4 id="managing_database">Database Manager</h4>
               <p>
                  The best way to accomplish the following tasks is to use <a title="Homepage" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=sqlitemanager+firefox&btnI=imfeelinglucky">SQLite Manager (Firefox extension)</a> do.
                  This program can easily edit and export the tables and insert images (products, see below),
                  execute SQL-queries and save new querrys as views.
               </p>
               <p>
                  After installation, the SQLiteManager in Firefox is in the menu <i>Tools</i> . After starting locate
                  the appropriate file (bksystem.sqlite) and open (<i>Database &rarr; Connect to database</i>).
                  We are interested in the tables <b>user_accounts</b>, <b>products</b>, <b>bill_dates</b>, <b>sales</b>,
                  and mainly the views <b>previous_account_list</b> (complete bill data), <b>previous_consumption</b>
                  (sold products) and <b>previous_account_balances</b> (sum for each user account). Select the corresponding table
                  and the tab <i>Browse</i> to se contents of the table/view. Now you can see the data sets and create,
                  edit and delete (all only tables).
               </p>
               <p>
                  <b>Warning:</b> Confirmed, changes can not directly make undo (CTRL-Z Undo, Undo), but only readd, delete, etc..
               </p>
                  The steps are described for the SQLite Manager, but can also be accomplished with any other program to
                  manipulate sqlite databases. Contents of tables can be viewed in the tab <i>browse</i>.
                  SQLiteManager offers (Tab also a box <i>running SQL</i> ),SQL code can be inserted and run.
                  For some tasks example SQL code is provided, possibly with parameters (eg replace "John Doe"
                  by value).
               <p>
               </p>
            <h4 id="tab_calc">Spreadsheet</h4>
               <p>
                  For the layout of bills, print and generate PDF a program needed to for spreadsheets. Examples are
                  Microsoft Excel, OpenOffice Calc and LibreOffice Calc. All steps are described for LibreOffice Calc.
                  The procedure with other programs should be very similar.
               </p>
            <h2 id="user_accounts">User Accounts</h2>
               <p>
                  The user accounts are saved in the table <b>user_accounts</b>.
               </p>

               <h3 id="add_user">Add Users</h3>
                  <p>
                     To create a new user account, select <i>browse</i> and <i>Add Record</i> . It must only be given
                     first name and last name, all other fields are automatically assigned to valid values.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     You may of course create accounts such as guests, cash purchase (to keep track of
                     consumption etc.), events or what ever.
                  </p>
               <h3 id="delete_user">Deleting a user</h3>
                  <p>
                     Users may also be deleted. Are any sales by the user that are not billed, the action is terminated
                     with an error message. Otherwise all of its sales are then deleted from the database (table sales).
                  </p>
               <h3 id="lock_user">User Lock / Unlock</h3>
                  <p>
                     User accounts may be blocked. Simply select the appropriate record and edit the status field.
                     The meaning of the status field is: 1 = user account is locked, 0 if not locked. Default value is 0.
                  </p>
               <h3 id="user_querry">Balance inquiry</h3>
                  <p>
                     All account balances can be used in view <b>current_account_balance</b> view.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     Personalized (complete or accumulated) shopping lists can be created only through SQL queries.
                     SQLiteManager offers (Tab also a box <i>running SQL</i> ) that in the code can be inserted and run.
                     Many queries are possible, the following are ready-for copy + paste and run. The name placeholder
                     must be replaced with the user name you want:
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <a href="SQL_Code/user_querry_complete.txt" title="Show SQL code">Purchase history</a>,
                     <a href="SQL_Code/user_querry_cumulativ.txt" title="View Code">amounts purchased</a>
                  </p>

                  <p>
                     To export the results tables of this query is possible ( <i>Action &rarr; Save result to CSV file</i> ),
                     then open with a spreadsheet), or view as CSV or it can be copied directly to office.
                  </p>


            <h2 id="products">Product List</h2>
               <p>
                  The products are stored in the table <b>products</b>.
               </p>

               <h3 id="add_product">Add Products</h3>
                  <p>
                     To add a product EAN, name, price (NOTE: use spot, ie 1.2, not a comma) must be given. Optionally,
                     an image can be added.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     EAN is the Eurpoean Article Number, which is found on every product under the bar code.
                     It is recommended to use this number. Any other <b>unique</b> number is also OK, so define
                     your own products, such as beer 0.5l, etc..
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     The price is set in euros (or whatever currency). It should be noted again that a point is to be
                     used (eg 1.25). The price may be changed at any time. Products already sold are not covered
                     by the price change. In the settlement, the product will appear twice (seperate for every price).
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     The image of the product is optional. Popular products are seperatedly shown in a list with images.
                     Accepted formats: jpg, jpeg, jpg, svg?. The best are jp(e)gs. The files should not exceed 500 KB
                     in size, 100 KB goes well. Google images helps here quick, with names or EANs. In SQLiteManager
                     the edit/create form provides a browse button, that allows easy import of images into the database.
                  </p>
               <h3 id="delete_product">Delete products</h3>
                  <p>
                     Products can be deleted from the table products. If products are that are not settled, deleting
                     will be canceled. All of the related sales are usually deleted from the database (Table sales).
                     Alternatively, set the product to not display (status = 1).
                  </p>
               <h3 id="hide_product">Products in the UI to hide the program</h3>
                  <p>
                     To avoid having to delete every product sold out it may be hidden.
                     The status indicates whether a product is to be displayed in the program (0) or not (1).
                  </p>


            <h2 id="sales">Sales</h2>
               <p>
                  The table <b>sales</b> will be written by the program, contains EAN, User ID, ​​and timestamp of the
                  sale, as well as the price.
               </p>
            <ul>
               <h3><a name="sale_cancel">Sales Cancel</a></h3>
                  <p>
                     Sales are undone (if not yet settled) by setting the corresponding cell <b>price</b> to 0.
                  </p>
               <h3><a name="sale_cleanup">Sales delete</a></h3>
                  <p>
                     If the sales data is no longer needed (eg after a cash balance), the corresponding records can be
                     deleted. Manually or <a href="SQL_Code/sales_cleanup.txt" title="View Code">automatically</a>
                     (erases all data billed). Please only delete records when billed and otherwise you can not redo!
                  </p>
            </ul>

            <h2 id="bill">Statements</h2>
               <p>The table <b>bill_dates</b> contains the billing reference dates.</p>
               <p>
                  There are six views that display the consumption of <b>consumption</b>, account balances
                  <b>account_balance</b> and bank statements <b>account_list</b> . Here, the prefix <b>previous</b>
                  refers to sales already billed (befor last reference date), <b>current</b> to the current consumption
                  (unbilled items). If a settlement is created (a date inserted to bill_dates), these <b>current</b> views
                  thus contain no data. All that was found there, is now displayed in the <b>previous</b>.
               </p>
               <p>
                  The View <b>previous_account_list</b> contains the entire current bill data, including userid,
                  full names, product information, and total number of each product. From this list, you can create
                  detailed <a href="bksystem_admin_eng.html#pivot_table">pivot table</a>
               </p>
               <p>
                  The View <b>previous_consumption</b> contains the current total consumption of products, including
                  EAN, product name and number.
               </p>
               <p>The View <b>previous_account_balance</b> contains the total sum all users.</p>
               <p>
                  After the creation of new a bill the contents of the views change. Older bills can only be through SQL queries
               </p>
               <p>
                  The ongoing items are in the views can be <b>current_account_balance</b> (sum for each user account),
                  <b>current_account_list</b> (all data) and <b>current_consumption</b>(consumption of products).

               <h3 id="generate_bill">Create</h3>
                  <p>
                     For billing you only need to insert a date in the table <b>bill_dates</b>. When creating a new entry
                     bill_id is set automatically. It's just the time stamp to be made ​​at which time a bill should be done.
                     The time stamp must be in the format <b>YYYY-MM-DD HH: MM: SS</b>(eg 2012-01-16 20:35:59).
                     The specified date must be newer than the last entry, and not be in the future.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     SQL queries can also be for today and now <a href="SQL_Code/get_date_now.txt" title="SQL code in message">

                  <p>
                     An entry in this table is sufficient to ensure that all views (previous_account_balance, previous_account_list, ...)
                     show new data. The billing and consumption are now in the tables <b>previous_account_list</b> (complete bill data),
                     <b>previous_consumption</b> (sold products) and <b>previous_account_balances</b> (sum for each user account).
                     These tables can now be as exported as CSV (can be opened with Excel, ...).

                  <p>
                      It can be undone by deleting the last row of Table <b>bill_dates</b>. All other tables will upddate accordingly.
                      <b>WARNING:</b> If users now have been deleted or products, they will no longer appear in the new bill.

                     <p>Now we have to be formatted a little. It is recommend the product names rotate through 90 degrees and then
                     automatically adjust its column width in order to save space. If formatting in the auto-generated
                     pivot table will not be possible: Cut and paste it into a new sheet. Then add more frames, rename sheet,
                     add text + date, etc..</p>

               <p>
                  There is also a backup script that can be executed at every automatic billing, too. Following steps describe the manually procedure.
               </p>
               <p>
                  The export function can also be used for backup tables. Select the desired table and the menu <i>table &rarr; Export table</i>
                  or in the tab <i>structure</i> the button <i>Export</i> to open the wizard. On the export Wizard select SQL .
                  The default options used. The content of this text file can <i>execute SQL</i>, Copy + Paste will read it again.
                  This should initially be done after setup of all data with the accounts and the products.
               </p>
               <p>To restore there is also a script, or it must be executed the files bkystem_scheme.sql, user_accounts.sql,
               products.sql, sales.sql, billdates.sql in an empty database ( <i>File&rarr; new database</i> ). To copy the text
               files in a simple query into the box and run. Restoring might generate some errors that refere to creating a table,
               that already exists. These errors can be ignored (They apper, because table creation is done in the scheme and the data file
               and therefore twice.).</p>
